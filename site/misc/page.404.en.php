/**
 * Custom 404 page, feel free to change it to fit your needs.
 *
 * Note (1): shows some helpful additional information in DEV mode.
 *
 * Note (2): When exporting as HTML or PHP, this page will be exported e.g. to 404.html or 404.php, respectively.
 * But that does not mean that it will automatically be used when a page is not found.
 *
 * If your web server has mod_rewrite enabled you need to add an .htaccess file specifying
 * ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
 *
 * If it does not, please get in touch with your hoster, there are probably has file name conventions for 404 pages,
 * e.g. that they must be called 404.html.
 *
 * Note (3): when used as described in (2), you might see broken links or references to javascript/stylesheets on
 * this page. If this is the case, please edit pheasel-config.php and insert a value for PHEASEL_CONTEXT_PATH, so
 * that the RequestHandler can insert references relative to the webserver root.
