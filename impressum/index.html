        currentness of content. In accordance with $7 paragraph 1 TMP we are responsible for all proprietary content of this
        website according to general law. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG we are not obliged to monitor transferred or
        stored information of third parties or to research possible unlawful actions. Obligations to the removal or blockage
        of the use of information according to the general laws remains untouched from this. Any liability in this respect
        is, however, only incurred from the moment that knowledge of the specific breach of law is obtained. As soon as we
        become aware of corresponding infringements of the law we shall remove this content immediately.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Liability for links</strong></p>

        control of the contents of the linked websites shall not be considered reasonable without a concrete indication for
        a violation of the law and will not be carried out. As soon as we become aware of a legal violation we will remove
        such contents immediately.
