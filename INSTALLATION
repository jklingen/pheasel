1. Extract the ZIP to the htdocs directory of your local web server (or to a subdirectory)

2. Unsually that's all. Start your web server (if it is not running yet) and 
   see http://localhost/ for more information (if you have used a subdirectory 
   in step 1, append it to the URL).
   
If you cannot see PHeasel's intro page yet, you might have to tweak one or another thing,
depending on your environment and web server configuration. Please make sure that

 * PHP is installed
 * mod_rewrite is enabled and AllowOverride is set to All
 * the web server has write access to the following subdirectories:
   * pheasel/cache
   * pheasel/logs
   * site-export
